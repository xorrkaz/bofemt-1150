# BOFEMT-1150: Programming Your Network With YANG

Welcome to the Programming Your Network with YANG Birds of a Feather.  Below you will find a collection of links to tools and training to get you started on your model-driven management journey.

-   [YANG Catalog](https://yangcatalog.org): Search for modules and nodes, view module details, and validate module syntax

-   [YANG Module GitHub Repo](https://github.com/YangModels/yang): GitHub repo featuring YANG modules from a number of standards bodies and vendors

-   [YANG Suite](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/yangsuite): Capable of dynamic discovery of installed application plugins. Provides common library APIs for logging, filesystem access, GUI appearance and behavior, and client-server communication

-   [ANX](https://github.com/cisco-ie/anx): This is a graphical explorer for YANG models supported by a NETCONF device or service orchestrator

-   [pyang](https://pypi.org/project/pyang/): CLI tool for validating YANG modules and viewing modules in tree form

-   [IOS-XE Programmability Learning Track](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/iosxe-programmability): Explore the reasons behind the move to Model Driven Programmability from traditional interfaces such as CLI/SNMP. Learn about the interaction between YANG data models and the new standard transport protocols of NETCONF and RESTCONF. Discover how to leverage NETCONF/RESTCONF to query and configure network devices

-   [NX-OS Programmability Learning Track](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/nxos-programmability): Learn YANG-based programming with Cisco NSOX native and Openconfig modules

-   [Getting Started with Cisco NSO](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/get_started_with_nso): Learn to use Cisco Network Service Orchestrator to configure network devices

-   [Cisco NSO Always-On Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/aa07cf66-b756-4424-99c1-4a93aa42c913?diagramType=Topology): Test Cisco NSO at any time with no reservation

-   [IOS-XE Programmability Always-On Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology): Test NETCONF and RESTCONF at any time with a CSR1000v

-   [Getting Started with Model-Driven Telemetry](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/getting-started-with-model-driven-telemetry): Blog showing off how to use Telegraf, Influx and Grafana to start visualizing your network from telemeetry streams

-   [Effectively Understand and Leverage YANG with NETCONF and RESTCONF for Model Driven Programmability - DGTL-BRKPRG-1368](https://www.ciscolive.com/global/on-demand-library.html?search=YANG&search.event=ciscoliveus2020#/session/1573153551504001JiOR): Cisco Live 2020 session breaking down the IETF standards of NETCONF, RESTCONF and YANG

-   [Network Automation using YANG Models across XE, XR, & NX](https://yang-prog-lab.ciscolive.com/pod/1): Cisco Live Hands-On session for exploring methods & tools of interacting with YANG, NETCONF, & RESTCONF
